# REDHAWK Socket Loopback Demo Waveform
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK Socket Loopback Demo Waveform. This waveform puts REDHAWK data out onto a network socket using sinksocket and then reads it back from the socket into REDHAWK via sourcesocket.  

## Build/Installation Instructions
This is a wavform project and thus does not need to be built just installed into the SDRROOT/dom/waveforms directory. One way to do that is to open the project in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR Folder.
